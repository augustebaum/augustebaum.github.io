Hi, I'm Auguste Baum! In case you were wondering, my first name is pronounced "August", like the month. I'm a software developer based in Paris, France currently interested in Nix, domain-driven development, and doing projects because they sound fun. I'm #openToWork!

I hold a Master's degree in Data Science from EPFL, in Switzerland. I have also been involved with [Resilio](https://www.resilio.tech), a start-up aiming to help companies reduce their environmental impact.
