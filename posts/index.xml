      <description>This post is adapted from a talk I gave at my place of work to convince them to try Nix for managing our projects&amp;rsquo; dependencies and deployment. It absolutely didn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;mdash;make of that what you will.&#xA;What is this thing called Nix? This is usually the most confusing part. Nix is an ecosystem of tools centered on making things declarative (you describe what you want, not how to get it&amp;mdash;think SQL or HTML) and reproducible (your project will still run with the same setup in 10 years, if all goes well).</description>

      <description>This post is adapted from a talk I gave at my place of work to convince them to try mob programming. I took some inspiration from Woody Zuil&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Mob Programming and the Power of Flow&amp;rdquo; talk, but the arguments reflect my own personal experiences at work&amp;mdash;if your experience doesn&amp;rsquo;t match mine, that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&#xA;Succinctly, mob programming consists in working on a task together with a group of people (a &amp;ldquo;mob&amp;rdquo;), usually software development.</description>

      <description>This summer I applied and was accepted to take part in Summer of Nix 2023, a 3- month paid part-time job packaging open-source software with Nix/NixOS. TL;DR: I had a great time, and I encourage anyone interested in Nix and programming to apply! Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of this post:&#xA;Summer of Nix 2023 in a Nutshell How I Got into Summer of Nix My Experience with Summer of Nix Final Remarks Summer of Nix 2023 in a Nutshell Summer of Nix is a part-time, paid program that lasts for 3 months in the (northern hemisphere) summer, wherein participants contribute to the Nix ecosystem.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I was proven right. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it.&#xA;When I was young I played video games a fair amount. My history with screens started early on, when I watched TV in the morning before going to school. One day, I found an old Game Boy Advance with a cartridge in. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what the game was, though it might have been Super Mario Advance. The screen was hard to see.</description>

      <description>This is a summary of my experience of the weekend on interpretability I spent from 2023-05-27 morning to 2023-05-28 evening. This was organized in Paris by EffiSciences.&#xA;Saturday Morning We got an introduction to AI risk and the idea of interpretability was introduced as a possible way to counter Goal Misgeneralization, whereby an AI can end up pursuing a goal that is different from the one that was intended, because it found a proxy to the &amp;ldquo;right solution&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Nix for Python, attempt number 2</title>

      <description>Last post we tried to make a Python project fully reproducible based on a detailed requirements.txt file. We ended up not managing to go the full Nix way, but we got pretty close. However, there are many ways to approach this, with language-specific tools getting published and archived on the regular.&#xA;At the end of the last post I mentioned dream2nix and their &amp;ldquo;Build your Python project in 10 minutes&amp;rdquo; tutorial which I would try out in a future post.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This is less of a tutorial and more of a record of my past experience&amp;mdash;in particular, I end up not reaching my stated goal for this post.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading this book on Hypermedia Systems, and one of the things they do is develop a small CRUD application in Python for which the code can be found here. Like the good software citizens they are, they&amp;rsquo;ve included a full detailed list of their project dependencies as a requirements.</description>
