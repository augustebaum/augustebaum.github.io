      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since May of this year I have been working as a software engineer at Probabl. I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to pursue personal projects during 20% of my working hours (one full day per week), as long as it&amp;rsquo;s reasonably close to my normal work, and that I regularly share what I learned with others. This post aims to fulfill the second condition!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each project I&amp;rsquo;ll give a description that answers these questions:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A very short introduction to Nix</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is adapted from a talk I gave at my place of work to convince them to try Nix for managing our projects&amp;rsquo; dependencies and deployment. It absolutely didn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;mdash;make of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-this-thing-called-nix&#34;&gt;What is this thing called Nix?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is usually the most confusing part. Nix is an ecosystem of tools centered on making things declarative (you describe what you want, not how to get it&amp;mdash;think SQL or HTML) and reproducible (your project will still run with the same setup in 10 years, if all goes well).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why you should try mob programming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is adapted from a talk I gave at my place of work to convince them to try mob programming. I took some inspiration from Woody Zuil&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/28S4CVkYhWA&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mob Programming and the Power of Flow&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; talk, but the arguments reflect my own personal experiences at work&amp;mdash;if your experience doesn&amp;rsquo;t match mine, that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Succinctly, mob programming consists in working on a task together with a group of people (a &amp;ldquo;mob&amp;rdquo;), usually software development. One programmer has control of the keyboard and types stuff, while the others talk things out and tell the typist what to do. Every 10 minutes or so, someone else becomes the typist, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My mob programming initiation at Summer of Nix 2023</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer I applied and was accepted to take part in Summer of Nix 2023, a 3- month paid part-time job packaging open-source software with Nix/NixOS. TL;DR: I had a great time, and I encourage anyone interested in Nix and programming to apply! Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of this post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Summer%20of%20Nix%202023%20in%20a%20Nutshell&#34;&gt;Summer of Nix 2023 in a Nutshell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#How%20I%20Got%20into%20Summer%20of%20Nix&#34;&gt;How I Got into Summer of Nix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#My%20Experience%20with%20Summer%20of%20Nix&#34;&gt;My Experience with Summer of Nix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Final%20Remarks&#34;&gt;Final Remarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;summer-of-nix-2023-in-a-nutshell&#34;&gt;Summer of Nix 2023 in a Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summer of Nix is a part-time, paid program that lasts for 3 months in the (northern hemisphere) summer, wherein participants contribute to the Nix ecosystem. This year it consisted in packaging various pieces of software, namely software that is supported by an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ngi.eu/about/&#34;&gt;NGI&lt;/a&gt; grant. Most participants like me were paid 3000 EUR for 160 hours (or 18.75 EUR/hour), while some participants with the role of &amp;ldquo;mob facilitators&amp;rdquo; were paid 5000 EUR for 160 hours (or 31.25 EUR/hour) for participating as well as taking on the responsibility for their mob (setting up the schedule, tools, communication&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was proven right. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was young I played video games a fair amount. My history with screens started early on, when I watched TV in the morning before going to school. One day, I found an old Game Boy Advance with a cartridge in. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what the game was, though it might have been Super Mario Advance. The screen was hard to see. After struggling with it for a while, I asked someone to help and they changed the batteries. After that I did see the screen better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Weekend on Neural Network Interpretability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of my experience of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/billets-week-end-de-formation-intensive-en-interpretabilite-601236714197&#34;&gt;the weekend on interpretability&lt;/a&gt; I spent from 2023-05-27 morning to 2023-05-28 evening.&#xA;This was organized in Paris by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.effisciences.org/&#34;&gt;EffiSciences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday-morning&#34;&gt;Saturday Morning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We got an introduction to AI risk and the idea of interpretability was introduced as a possible way to counter &lt;a href=&#34;https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/goal-misgeneralisation-why-correct-specifications-arent-enough-for-correct-goals-cf96ebc60924&#34;&gt;Goal Misgeneralization&lt;/a&gt;, whereby an AI can end up pursuing a goal that is different from the one that was intended, because it found a proxy to the &amp;ldquo;right solution&amp;rdquo;. This implies that if the proxy behaves differently in deployment than in training, the agent will still just follow the proxy even if this yields bad outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We ended up not managing to go the full Nix way, but we got pretty close. However, there are many ways to approach this, with language-specific tools getting published and archived on the regular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the last post I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://nix-community.github.io/dream2nix/&#34;&gt;dream2nix&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&#34;https://nix-community.github.io/dream2nix/guides/getting-started-python.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Build your Python project in 10 minutes&amp;rdquo; tutorial&lt;/a&gt; which I would try out in a future post. This is that post!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This is less of a tutorial and more of a record of my past experience&amp;mdash;in particular, I end up not reaching my stated goal for this post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading this book on &lt;a href=&#34;https://hypermedia.systems&#34;&gt;Hypermedia Systems&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the things they do is develop a small CRUD application in Python for which the code can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bigskysoftware/contact-app&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Like the good software citizens they are, they&amp;rsquo;ve included a full detailed list of their project dependencies as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bigskysoftware/contact-app/blob/master/requirements.txt&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
